ub list:
- string literals larger than max int size
- created strings larger than max int size
- lists larger than max int size
≈ string->integer creates an integer that's oob (isnt pretty)
≈ eval a variable which doesnt exist (not great)
PROMPT: problems reading from stdin (closed, etc), reading chars which arent valid strings 
OUTPUT: any problems when writing to stdout
DUMP: any problems writing to stdout

√ CALL: anything other than BLOCK's return value
√ QUIT: exit status isn't wihtin 0..=127
√ ASCII: integer's not in the encoding, empty string, other types
√ DUMP: for blocks
√ [: empty string/list, other types
√ ]: empty string/list, other types
√ +: other types
√ -: other types
√ *: second arg negative for strings/lists, other types
√ /: zero for second argument, other types
√ %: first arg negative, second arg zero or negative, other types
√ ^: second arg negative for ints, other types
√ <: either argument is a list and has blocks, other types
√ >: either argument is a list and has blocks, other types
√ ?: either argument is a list and has blocks, other types
√ =: first argument isn't a variable
√ tokens after the first expression in the file
√ invalid chars in a string
√ int literals larger than max size
√ strings not to have a closing quote
√ variable names longer than 127
√ fewer expression than required for a function
√ parens dont enclose a single expression
√ converting blocks to any type
√ over/underflow for any integer
√ GET: second or third args negative, or their sum > length, other types
√ SET: second or third args negative, or their sum > length, other types
√ using blocks anywhere other than:
	- sole argument to `:`, `BLOCK`, `CALL`, `,`
	- second arg to `=`
	- either arg of `;`
	- second or third arg of `IF`
